    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>How do I set up my golf bag?</h3>
            <p>Go to the "Bag Setup" tab in the app. Tap "Manage Bag" to select clubs from categories like Drivers, Woods, Hybrids, Irons, and Wedges. Your selections are saved automatically.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How do I start a new test session?</h3>
            <p>In the "Test" tab, enter the number of shots, minimum yardage, and maximum yardage. Tap "Start Test" to generate random targets. Submit each shot with club, distance, and deviation details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What do the test scores mean?</h3>
            <p>Scores range from 0-100, based on distance accuracy and deviation penalties. Green (80+) indicates excellent performance, yellow (50-80) is good with room for improvement, and red (below 50) suggests focusing on accuracy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Why isn't my data saving or showing in History/Club Data?</h3>
            <p>Data is stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. Ensure the app has storage permissions in your iPhone Settings. If issues persist, try force-quitting the app or restarting your device. Contact us with details if needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How can I reset my test history or bag setup?</h3>
            <p>Currently, there's no in-app reset button. You can clear app data by uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but this will erase all saved progress. We're considering adding a reset feature in future updates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What does the trend in History mean?</h3>
            <p>The trend (Improving, Stable, Declining) is calculated from your recent 5 sessions using simple linear regression on scores. Use the insights and tips provided to improve.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How is club data calculated?</h3>
            <p>Club stats like average distance, min/max, deviation, and score are aggregated from all your test shots. The score factors in dispersion and variance—higher is better (green for 80+, yellow 50-80, red below).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Does the app collect any personal data?</h3>
            <p>No, all data is stored locally on your device and not shared with us or third parties. For more details, see our <a href="YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL_HERE">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>The app crashed—what should I do?</h3>
            <p>Update to the latest version via the App Store. If it persists, note what you were doing (e.g., submitting a shot) and email us with your device model and iOS version for assistance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Can I suggest new features?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! We're always improving. Email your ideas to us—we value user feedback for future updates like voice input or on-course tracking.</p>
